        "At ombligo, we encountered a scenario where we needed 2 meet a deadline for a major e-commerce platform overhaul. The goal was 2 enhance the UI/UX on the site. I conducted a thorough analysis of the site, understanding the scope, breaking down deliverables, and identifying opportunities. I established milestones to track progress and ensure each aspect of the overhaul was on schedule. I collaborated with the sales team and the COO 2 ensure every1 was on the same page. I leveraged AI tools to streamline problem-solving and decision-making, regularly evaluating progress against set milestones. Despite the challenging deadline, I successfully completed the overhaul on time, resulting in a more intuitive and accessible storefront, garnering positive feedbacks from the sales team, COO, and customers.
