        "Observing a known object -- does it yeild certain known causes? ",
        "Yes, an observed object, it yields specific effects which we have experienced to proceed from a known cause. Such as a watch or a house both or which we know it to have a designer that design those objects into existence. "

        "In general when observing two constructs be it physical or abstract -- can you infer a conclusion from the observation of another? ",
        "No, examination of two constructs can yeild specific effects (conclusion) but its origin cannot be inferred based on knowledge of the origin of the other. Similar effects do not mean similar causes of origin. "

        "Does nature yeild effects from reasoning either from itself or from a divine being? ",
        "No, elements in nature do not yield to produce effects from reasoning. Only in the minds of humans can ideas be arranged themselves to produce effects from reasoning. "

        "If nature can be described from mathematical reasoning does it imply that nature itself is derived from divine reasoning? ",
        "The relationship between nature, mathematics, and divine reasoning is a topic of philosophical and theological debate. Different perspectives exist on this matter, and there is no universally accepted answer. Some philosophers and theologians argue that the existence of mathematical laws and patterns in nature points towards a deeper order or intelligence underlying the universe, which could be attributed to a divine reasoning or intelligence. They see mathematics as a language or tool through which we can uncover the inherent structure and harmony in the natural world. It's important to note that these perspectives involve different philosophical and metaphysical assumptions and can be influenced by personal beliefs and worldviews. The question of whether the mathematical description of nature implies divine reasoning is a matter of interpretation and individual perspective. It falls within the realm of philosophy, theology, and personal beliefs rather than being a question that can be definitively answered through empirical evidence alone."

        "What is the classical tenant for an argument from experience, concerning the knowledge of one construct when a known knowledge is had about the construct of another? ",
        "The classical argument is that when two objects are always observed to be conjoined, one can infer the existence of one whenever the other is observed because this is the effect to which the conjoined objects have yeild to produced. "

        "From the 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion' what is the lesson learned about observing components in isolation and their relationship with each other? ",
        "Question the validity of drawing conclusions from observation of components. Components may interact but it doesn not imply that these components have the same cause/origin. A dog and a bird can coexist in mutual benefit but they do not oshare the same origin. "
