    "Discovery of atomic particles was made by looking at the charge-to-mass ratio. The ratio was observed by looking at the changes in the discrete spectral lines emitted by atoms when they were placed in a magnetic field -- discrete lines means discrete energy lvls. When a uniform mag field of strength $B$ is est perpendicular 2da direction of motion of a charged particle the particle moves in a tradjectory path. The radius of curvature is obtain from Newton's 2nd law by setting the magnetic force $quB$ equal 2 the mass times the centripetal acc $u^2/R$ where u is the speed of da particle. "
